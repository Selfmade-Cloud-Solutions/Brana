Future<void> _checkOnboardingStatus() async {
  try {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    bool hasCompletedOnboarding = prefs.getBool('hasCompletedOnboarding') ?? false;
    bool isLoggedOut = prefs.getBool('isLoggedOut') ?? true;
    bool isLoggedIn = prefs.getBool('isLoggedIn') ?? false;

    if (isLoggedOut) {
      // User is logged out, navigate to login page
      _navigateToLogin();
    } else if (isLoggedIn) {
      // User is logged in, navigate to homepage
